General approach:

User Stories:
- Tennis players of all levels who do not have easy access to tennis courts want to be able to play in or around their area by connecting with other players who have access.
- Tennis players can find other players of a similar skill level, organize or join events (i.e. rallies, matches,coaching session).
- More advanced Tennis players who are willing to teach others in an informal setting do not have the platform or network to do so.
-Tennis players can search for events to join around their area.
